# About me

This is the repo for my CS 131 Class.

## Introduction

Hello, my name is Calvin and currently taking CS 131 C++.

## My Background

Coding and computers have interested me for as long as I can remember, because of this I am looking to get a degree in computer engineering. Not too sure what exactly what I want to do with said education but I have a few ideas.

## Why C++

C++ is a language I want to learn because of its scope and capabilities.

## Programming Knowledge

I have toyed around with C++ and Java quite a bit and took a class on Python last quarter.

## Favorites

I have many favorite "things", a few are

- Music and music production
- Video Game (Most recently played)
- - KCD2
- - Stardew valley
- - Minecraft
- - many others, too lazy to list 'em
