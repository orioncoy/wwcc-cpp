# Midterm

## Building

### Setting up the Makefile

Make sure to:
 - `CXX`: set to a compiler you have installed
 - `CXXFLAGS`: add any flags you deem necessary under

> [!WARNING] 
> This project uses C++17, change this at your own risk.

```
# Compiler and Flags
CXX = g++
CXXFLAGS = -Wall -std=c++17
```

### Building
1. Navigate to `../wwcc_cpp/week5/midterm/` in your terminal.
2. Enter command `make`.
3. The output `task_manager` should show up in the `../midterm/` directory.
4. If it does not build, double check you have the compiler installed with the correct flags and try again.
